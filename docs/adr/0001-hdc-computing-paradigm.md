# ADR-0001: Hyperdimensional Computing Paradigm Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The robotics control system requires a computational paradigm that can handle:
- Real-time sensor fusion from multiple modalities
- One-shot learning from demonstrations
- Fault tolerance with sensor failures
- Efficient memory-based reasoning

## Decision
We will use Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) as the core computational paradigm.

## Rationale
HDC provides several key advantages:

### 1. Natural Fault Tolerance
- High-dimensional vectors are inherently noise-resistant
- Partial vector corruption doesn't significantly affect similarity
- Graceful degradation with missing sensor modalities

### 2. Efficient One-Shot Learning
- New behaviors can be learned from single demonstrations
- No gradient descent or lengthy training procedures required
- Immediate storage and retrieval of learned patterns

### 3. Real-Time Performance
- Simple operations (XOR, majority) enable fast computation
- GPU acceleration provides 10x+ performance improvements
- Deterministic execution times suitable for real-time control

### 4. Multi-Modal Fusion
- Natural binding of different sensor modalities
- Compositional representations enable complex reasoning
- Unified vector space for all sensor types

## Alternatives Considered

### Deep Neural Networks
- **Pros**: Excellent pattern recognition, mature tooling
- **Cons**: Requires extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, not fault-tolerant
- **Verdict**: Not suitable for one-shot learning and fault tolerance requirements

### Traditional Robotics Stack
- **Pros**: Well-established, predictable behavior
- **Cons**: Brittle to sensor failures, limited learning capability
- **Verdict**: Doesn't meet adaptive learning requirements

### Reinforcement Learning
- **Pros**: Good for sequential decision making
- **Cons**: Requires extensive environment interaction, sample inefficient
- **Verdict**: Too slow for one-shot learning requirements

## Implementation Details
- **Vector Dimension**: 10,000 (optimal for performance vs. accuracy)
- **Encoding**: Spatial, temporal, and feature-based encoders
- **Memory**: Associative memory with similarity-based retrieval
- **Hardware**: CPU/GPU hybrid with CUDA acceleration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enables one-shot learning from demonstrations
- Provides natural fault tolerance
- Supports real-time performance requirements
- Unified framework for all sensor modalities

### Negative
- Less mature ecosystem compared to deep learning
- Requires custom implementation of many components
- Limited availability of pre-trained models

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking
- Fallback mechanisms for critical operations
- Gradual integration with existing robotics infrastructure

## Compliance
This decision aligns with the requirement for adaptive, fault-tolerant robotics control systems capable of one-shot learning.

## Notes
This ADR establishes HDC as the foundational computing paradigm for the entire system. All subsequent architectural decisions should consider HDC capabilities and constraints.
